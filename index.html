    <!--<h2>Summary</h2>-->
    <p>
      <table class="index">
        The social robot navigation community has reached a crucial point. Despite the massive paper production, there is no common language among researchers.
 
		Specifically, we observe that:
		<ul>
		<li> There is no consensus over the complete set of features that make human pedestrian navigation social. As a result, different researchers focus on engineering completely different aspects of socially acceptable behavior.
		There are not enough open human datasets that the community can use. The existing datasets are suffering from several issues (camera placement, obstacles/arrangement is biasing traffic). But we also don’t have a good idea of what constitutes a good dataset. </li>
		<li> There is no consensus over a validation standard. Different works adopt different settings, experimental setups, scenarios, robot platforms, baselines, and metrics. As a result, there is often no good way of relating a work to another. </li>
		<li> The results included in robotics papers in general (but this community’s even more) are often lacking statistical rigor. We need to follow more closely best reporting practices from communities that adopt a more formal methodology when conducting empirical studies (e.g., experimental psychology). </li>
		</ul>

    <p>
          Motivated by these observations, we would like to call a diverse, multidisciplinary audience to participate in an interactive, discussion-oriented workshop. We would like to hear from roboticists, psychologists, sociologists on how we can develop better standards for the social robot navigation community. Our goal is to open the discussion over all above topics and reach a consensus over: (1) social robot definitions; (2) the desired attributes of good human datasets; (3) validation benchmarks; (4) best practices in reporting results. The ideal outcome of this workshop will be a summary of our discussions and findings in a journal article. Some of the insights that we hope to extract will also be applicable to other areas of robotics.

    <h3>Key Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the value of simulation in the domain of social robot navigation?
      <li>How do we build a simulation environment for validation of social navigation methodologies?</li>
      <li>What are the advatanges and limitations of machine learning when it comes to the deployment of social robot navigation platforms in real-world environments?</li>
      <li>What are the appropriate abstractions to represent complex crowd behaviors for the purposes of perception, planning and control? How do we ensure computational tractability and scalability?</li>
      <li>How do we ensure safety and how do we handle the lack of any potential guarantees?</li>
      <li>How do we deal with the inability of controlling variables in experimental settings?</li>
      <li>What is the right level of abstraction for the context? How do we incorporate context models and parameters?</li>
      <li>How should the robot behave? Do we want it to mimic humans?</li>
      <li>How do we deal with the robot’s form factor or the novelty effect?</li>
      <li>What are some good baselines? How do we ensure that are accessible to the community?</li>
      <li>What are some appropriate benchmarks?</li>
