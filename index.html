    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      <table class="index">
        The social robot navigation community has reached a crucial point. Despite the massive paper production, there is no common language among researchers.
 
		Specifically, we observe that:
		<ul>
		<li> There is no consensus over the complete set of features that make human pedestrian navigation social. As a result, different researchers focus on engineering completely different aspects of socially acceptable behavior.
		There are not enough open human datasets that the community can use. The existing datasets are suffering from several issues (camera placement, obstacles/arrangement is biasing traffic). But we also don’t have a good idea of what constitutes a good dataset. </li>
		<li> There is no consensus over a validation standard. Different works adopt different settings, experimental setups, scenarios, robot platforms, baselines, and metrics. As a result, there is often no good way of relating a work to another. </li>
		<li> The results included in robotics papers in general (but this community’s even more) are often lacking statistical rigor. We need to follow more closely best reporting practices from communities that adopt a more formal methodology when conducting empirical studies (e.g., experimental psychology). </li>
 
		<li> Motivated by these observations, we would like to call a diverse, multidisciplinary audience to participate in an interactive, discussion-oriented workshop. We would like to hear from roboticists, psychologists, sociologists on how we can develop better standards for the social robot navigation community. Our goal is to open the discussion over all above topics and reach a consensus over: (1) social robot definitions; (2) the desired attributes of good human datasets; (3) validation benchmarks; (4) best practices in reporting results. The ideal outcome of this workshop will be a summary of our discussions and findings in a journal article. Some of the insights that we hope to extract will also be applicable to other areas of robotics. </li>
		</ul>
