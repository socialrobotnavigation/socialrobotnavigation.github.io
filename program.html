  Our goal is to organize a truly interactive workshop that will convene small, interdisciplinary working group sessions around each of the workshop’s focus topics. We will run a sequential set of three workshopping sessions, each focused on one of the key topics. Each session will begin with either an invited speaker or a panel of speakers, who will provoke the audience with controversial ideas, stories, and/or arguments that lead to challenging questions.  In particular, each organizer will moderate one focus topic, each invited speaker will be assigned to one or more focus topics, and the moderators will dialogue with each speaker about their focus topic in advance of the workshop.  
  <br><br>

The following is the current assignment schedule (although this can change as the workshop evolves):
<br><br>
<u><b>Focus topic 1</b></u>
<br>
<i>What are the most important variables that influence social robot navigation performance? In other words, what levers should we be exploring?</i>
<br>
<b>Speakers</b>: Takayuki Kanda, Wendy Ju
<br>
<b>Moderator</b>: Leila Takayama, Marynel Vázquez
<br><br>

<u><b>Focus topic 2</b></u>
<br>
<i>What are some important tradeoffs in selecting representations for perception, planning, and control in social robot navigation?</i>
<br>
<b>Speakers</b>: Reid Simmons, Jon How, Aleksandra Faust
<br>
<b>Moderator</b>: Chris Mavrogiannis, Marynel Vázquez 
<br><br>

<u><b>Focus topic 3</b></u>
<br>
<i>How should we collect (or generate) and use data for social robot navigation?</i>
<br>
<b>Speakers</b>: Anca Dragan, Todd Murphey</b>
<br>
<b>Moderator</b>: Pete Trautman, Francesca Baldini
<br><br>
After each “provocation talk”, the organizers will divide up the workshop attendees into small, interdisciplinary working groups. Using the challenge question as a prompt, we will task each small group to share their perspectives with each other and brainstorm answers. One team member in each small group will be tasked with capturing the ideas, which will then be shared with the full set of workshop participants. Together, the small groups will brainstorm, summarize, and present their key findings to the full workshop group at the end of each of the three working sessions. 
<br><br>
To provide both grounding and inspiration for these workshopping sessions, we will also run two sets of lightning talks and associated poster presentations by students between each of the three workshopping sessions.
