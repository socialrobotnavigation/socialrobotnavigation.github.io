        <p> Chris (Christoforos) Mavrogiannis is a postdoctoral research associate in the Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, working with Prof. Srinivasa. His interests lie at the intersection of motion planning, multiagent navigation, and human-robot interaction, and he often draws tools from topology and machine learning. He is currently working on the design of planning algorithms for robot navigation in multiagent environments including driving domains and crowded pedestrian spaces. He is also leading MuSHR, the lab's project on the development of an autonomous robotic racecar, and coordinates the lab's contributions to the Honda Curious Minded Machine Project for the development of robots that leverage curiosity to interact seamlessly with their human partners. Chris holds MS and PhD degrees from Cornell University, and a Diploma in mechanical engineering from the National Technical University of Athens.</p>

        <p>Pete Trautman received his B.S. in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Baylor University in 2000. He then entered the United States Air Force, serving as a program manager and researcher at the Sensors Directorate. In 2012, he completed his Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems at Caltech. His thesis research focused on robot navigation in dense human crowds, the result of which was a probabilistic model of human robot cooperation, a 6 month case study in Caltech’s student cafeteria and an ICRA 2013 Best Paper Finalist award. Pete has since worked in Boeing factory automation and defense contracting. He now works at the Honda Research Institute USA on robot navigation in human crowds.</p>

        <p>Siddhartha S. Srinivasa is the Boeing Endowed Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington. He earned his PhD in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. He works on robotic manipulation, with the goal of enabling robots to perform complex manipulation tasks under uncertainty and clutter, with and around people. To this end, he founded the Personal Robotics Lab in 2005. He is also passionate about building end-to-end systems (HERB, ADA, HRP3, CHIMP, Andy, among others) that integrate perception, planning, and control in the real world. Understanding the interplay between system components has helped produce state-of-the-art algorithms for robotic manipulation, motion planning, object recognition, and pose estimation (MOPED), dense 3-D modeling (CHISEL, now used by Google Project Tango), and mathematical models for human–robot collaboration.</p>
